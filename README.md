As a client, I want to be able to create, view, track , and log workouts. I want to be able to log multiple workouts. I want to also be able to track name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise, as well as cardio if done.

I want to show code that creates a Mongo Database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes using Express.js
